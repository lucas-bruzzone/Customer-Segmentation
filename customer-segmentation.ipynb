These features can be particularly important for understanding and predicting customer segments. Let's highlight some of them:\n\n1. **<font color=\"#964400\">Profession (0.20)</font>**:\n   - The 'Profession' feature shows a positive correlation of 0.20 with customer segmentation. This suggests that customers' professions may influence their market segment. For example, certain professions may be associated with different income levels, needs, and purchasing behaviors.\n\n2. **<font color=\"#964400\">Family_Size (0.19)</font>**:\n   - The 'Family_Size' characteristic has a positive correlation of 0.19 with segmentation. This indicates that family size may play a role in determining the market segment. Customer segments with larger families may have distinct needs and preferences compared to smaller families.\n\n3. **<font color=\"#964400\">Spending_Score (0.10)</font>**:\n   - The 'Spending_Score' feature exhibits a positive correlation of 0.10 with segmentation. This suggests that customers' spending behavior is relevant to defining their segments. Customers with different spending scores may be directed to specific segments based on their purchasing power.\n\n4. **<font color=\"#964400\">Graduated (-0.18)</font>**:\n   - 'Graduated' presents a negative correlation of -0.18. This implies that completing graduation can significantly influence a customer's market segment. Customers with an academic background may belong to different segments compared to those without formal education.\n\n5. **<font color=\"#964400\">Ever_Married (-0.22)</font>**:\n   - The 'Ever_Married' feature has a negative correlation of -0.22. This indicates that customers' marital status plays a crucial role in determining the segment. Married or unmarried individuals may have distinct needs and purchasing behaviors.\n\n6. **<font color=\"#964400\">Age (-0.24)</font>**:\n   - The 'Age' feature exhibits a negative correlation of -0.24. This suggests that customers' age has a substantial impact on their segmentation. Different age groups can be grouped into specific segments due to varied consumption behaviors throughout life.\n\nThese features with significant correlations can be valuable for developing targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments based on their individual characteristics. They provide useful insights for understanding customer behavior and can aid in making more informed decisions regarding business strategy.</font>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <font color=\"#964400\">Scatter Analysis</font>\n\nIn this analysis, we explore the use of scatter plots in understanding the distribution of data points in our dataset. Scatter plots are an essential tool for visualizing relationships and patterns in data points, especially in multidimensional datasets. For our analysis, we utilized scatter plots to gain insights into the distribution of data points in two different scenarios: the complete training dataset and a reduced dataset with selected features. The goal was to highlight the importance of feature selection in improving the interpretability and clarity of scatter plots.\n\n### Full Training Dataset\n\nIn the first scenario, we created scatter plots using the complete training dataset. This dataset contains a wide range of features, some of which may not be highly relevant for our analysis. While scatter plots can provide valuable insights, visualizing data in high dimensions can be overwhelming, making it challenging to identify meaningful patterns.\n\nDespite the challenges presented by the full dataset, we were able to observe some interesting trends and clusters in the scatter plots. These insights provided a starting point for our analysis and allowed us to identify areas of interest.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA, NMF, FastICA\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D\n\nclass Decomp:\n    def __init__(self, n_components, method=\"pca\", scaler_method='standard'):\n        self.n_components = n_components\n        self.method = method\n        self.scaler_method = scaler_method\n        self.mixing_ = None\n        \n    def dimension_reduction(self, df):\n        X_reduced = self.dimension_method(df)\n        if self.n_components == 2:\n            df_comp = pd.DataFrame(X_reduced, columns=[f'{self.method.upper()}_{_}' for _ in range(self.n_components)], index=df.index)\n        elif self.n_components == 3:\n            df_comp = pd.DataFrame(X_reduced, columns=[f'{self.method.upper()}_{_}' for _ in range(self.n_components)], index=df.index)\n        return df_comp\n    \n    def dimension_method(self, df):\n        X = self.scaler(df)\n        if self.method == \"pca\":\n            pca = PCA(n_components=self.n_components, random_state=0)\n            X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)\n            self.comp = pca\n        elif self.method == \"nmf\":\n            nmf = NMF(n_components=self.n_components, random_state=0)\n            X_reduced = nmf.fit_transform(X)\n        elif self.method == \"ica\":\n            comp = FastICA(n_components=self.n_components, whiten='unit-variance', random_state=0)\n            X_reduced = comp.fit_transform(X)\n            self.mixing_ = comp.mixing_  #

Conclusion</font>\n\nIn this customer segmentation prediction project, we applied various machine learning models to classify customers into different segments based on their characteristics. After a thorough analysis of the results, we've come to some important conclusions.\n\n## <font color=\"#964400\">Model Evaluation</font>\n\nWe evaluated the models using both the training and test datasets. Here are the accuracy scores for each model on the test data:\n\n- Random Forest: 0.98\n- C5 (Decision Tree): 0.93\n- HistGradientBoostingClassifier: 0.99\n- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors): 0.93\n\nThe accuracy scores are impressive, indicating that our models are performing exceptionally well in classifying customers into segments. However, accuracy alone may not be the only factor to consider when choosing the best model.\n\n## <font color=\"#964400\">Model Selection</font>\n\nWhen selecting the best model for customer segmentation, we need to consider factors beyond just accuracy. The choice of the most suitable model depends on the specific requirements of the business problem and the interpretability of the model.\n\n- **Random Forest**: Achieved the highest accuracy of 0.98. It's a powerful ensemble model that provides good results. However, it may lack interpretability compared to simpler models.\n\n- **C5 (Decision Tree)**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.93. Decision trees are known for their interpretability, making it easier to understand how predictions are made.\n\n- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier**: Achieved the highest accuracy of 0.99. This model combines the strengths of gradient boosting with histogram-based learning, offering high accuracy and good interpretability.\n\n- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Achieved an accuracy of 0.93. KNN is straightforward and interpretable, but it might not perform as well as ensemble models in complex datasets.\n\nConsidering the high accuracy and interpretability, we choose the **HistGradientBoostingClassifier** as the model to build personas for each class.\n\n## <font color=\"#964400\">Dimensionality Reduction Technique</font>\n\nOne key aspect of our analysis was the reduction of dimensionality. We utilized Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to transform our data into a lower-dimensional space. ICA was chosen for its ability to capture independent components in the data.\n\nBy reducing dimensionality using ICA, we simplified the dataset while retaining its essential information. This allowed our models to perform efficiently and effectively, as reflected in the high accuracy scores.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of the powerful **HistGradientBoostingClassifier** model and effective dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly ICA, enabled us to successfully segment customers with high accuracy. The choice of the best model aligns with the specific business needs and interpretability requirements.\n","metadata":{}}],"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}}
